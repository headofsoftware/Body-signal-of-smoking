### What are you doing this data analysis project for?

This data contains information about people who smoke and do not smoke. In light of this data, it aims to predict whether an individual is smoking using the data available to an individual. In addition, differences can be detected in people who smoke and do not smoke, taking into account the dataset. The models that are created can also be used to detect damage to their bodies that may occur to people who do not smoke.


### What are you trying to calculate and why?

A total of 24 features are available on the Veriseti. Not all of these features are required to create models. So we're trying to determine which information is decisive and which are insignificant when making an estimate of whether or not the individual is using cigarettes. This allows more accurate results with less information available. What are the changes in the body of non-smoking individuals as a result of data analysis?

# Motivation

Information can be used as a deterrent to expose negative effects on people and to give up smoking so that people who smoke and smoke can have a healthier life. In this respect, it can be used as a deterrent to start smoking or to deter people who have been using it for a long time. It also allows early detection and intervention of smoking young people by their parents.

# Results

## Stunning Results
*As a result of studies on Veriseti, men make up about 95% of the people who use cigarettes.

* When the correlation of features on the Veriseti is examined, the labels and high correlation characteristics are the same it was seen that he had a high correlation in the gender feature district in time. Therefore, in the examinations, the separation as a male/female is made by the after it was done, the inspections were done.

Differences between smokers and non-smokers:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Triglyceride has a difference of between 10% and 20% in people who smoke and do not smoke.</li>
          <lu>High triglyceride artery hardening causes thickening of the vessel walls. This increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, various cardiovascular                     diseases. It also causes pancreatic inflammation. If not intervened, it can also invite diabetes and hypertension.
          </lu>
      <li>In smokers, GTP is 20% lower than non-smokers.</li>
